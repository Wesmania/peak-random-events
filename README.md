Adds random modifiers to each biome. For now they remain secret to not spoil the fun.

**This is a client side mod!** Make sure all players have this mod when playing the game.

**This is an alpha version**. Here are the things that weren't tested or implemented:

* Best-effort support for players re-joining. Might be buggy.
* No support for changing host.

## Installation

Either automatically via mod manager, or extract the mod's plugins directory to BepInEx/plugins.

## Usage

Press F3 to see event descriptions again after they disappear.

### TODO

* Test multiplayer.
* Handle players joining/leaving more gracefully.

* New effects:
  * Bring up a pawn, or suffer a curse.
  * More/fewer items. (mod integration)
  * Scout punching.
  * Other mod integrations.
