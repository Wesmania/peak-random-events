Adds random modifiers to each biome. For now they remain secret to not spoil the fun.

**This is a client side mod!** Make sure all players have this mod when playing the game.

**This is an alpha version**. Here are the things that weren't tested or implemented:

* Multiplayer was not tested. In principle it should work, but there may be bugs.
* No support for players leaving/joining yet. Players joining won't experience
  some random modifiers. Hosts leaving might break some modifiers.

## Installation

Either automatically via mod manager, or extract the mod's plugins directory to BepInEx/plugins.

### TODO

* Test multiplayer.
* Handle players joining/leaving more gracefully.

* New effects:
  * Bring up a pawn, or suffer a curse.
  * More/fewer items. (mod integration)
  * Scout punching.
  * Other mod integrations.
